# adversarial-attacks-resnet34-imagenet
This repository contains the code, results, and adversarial examples from our project evaluating the robustness of a pretrained ResNet-34 model against adversarial attacks on the ImageNet-1K dataset. We explore three attack methods: Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM), Projected Gradient Descent (PGD), and a spatially constrained patch-based attack.
